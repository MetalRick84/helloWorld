# helloWorld
just playing around

this line was added via github.com-Website

this line was added in a new temporary branch (branch A)
next step: make a pull-request

I cloned the repo with VScode and created a new branch (branch B)
Where do I see on wich branch I am in VScode?
Another commit in branch B with VScode

I unintentionally merged "branch B" with "main" in VScode.
I cloned the repo again and made "branch C" in VScode.
Now I will try to make a pull-Request in VScode to merge "main" an "branch C"
